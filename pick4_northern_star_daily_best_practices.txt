Pick 4 Northern Star — Daily Best Practices (Top2 members, no Rare/Ultra)

Definition of a 'captured hit' (Top2-only mode)
- A captured hit means: the winning draw is a FAMILY DOUBLES member (Structure = AABC), and its member label (AABC/ABBC/ABCC) is in your Top2 member picks for that core (and in the stream(s) you actually play).
- AAAB / AABB / AAAA are NOT counted as captured hits unless you explicitly add plays for them.

Daily workflow (recommended)
1) Load data
   - Upload the all-states history CSV (LotteryPost export) OR use the on-disk rolling store.
   - Optional: upload the 24-hour file. If missing, the app still runs (24h features will be skipped).

2) Choose cores
   - Start with your target cores (e.g., 389, 016, 129, etc.).
   - Keep 'Top2 members only' when minimizing plays.

3) Build today's playlist
   - Use Northern Lights to generate the ranked Core+Stream playlist.
   - Verify the build stamp matches the filename (avoids stale deployments).

4) Validate (no-cheat)
   - Go to Backtest → Walk-forward (no cheating).
   - Use: window_days = 180 (or 365), include_rare = OFF (Top2-only intent), member basis = Per-core+stream (if enough samples).
   - Turn OFF 'Diagnostic only: evaluate only hit days' when you want true per-draw denominators (EV / cost).

5) Use the Validator (60 hits / 60 days target)
   - Validator is the ONLY place meant to answer: 'Do we consistently hit ≥60 in 60 days with minimal plays?'
   - Train = 180 days; refresh = 7 days; test = next 60 days.
   - Require the playlist to satisfy multiple 60-day slices inside training (reduces overfit).
   - Then check the test-window hits and the plays/day.

Interpreting the Backtest panels (quick)
- Walk-forward summary: % predicted of core-family wins (this is NOT the same as 60/60-day goal).
- Member pick accuracy: Top1/Top2 rates for predicting which member label hits when a core hits.
- Box-first KPI: cost/plays/hits under the 'box first, straight add-on' plan. Uses ALL draws when configured that way.
- By core / By stream: where the model is strongest; use it to trim plays safely.
- Manual day replay: sanity-check one date end-to-end (what the model would have recommended that day).

Best-practice defaults (min-spend)
- Window days: 180
- Refresh (Validator): 7 days
- Member picks: Top2 (not Top1)
- Rare/Ultra: OFF (unless you explicitly budget for them)
